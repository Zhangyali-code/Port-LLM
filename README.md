## Get started
* The code for model training is in the `train`, while the code utilized for testing the model across multiple antennas at the base station can be found in the `Multiantenna_test`. `other_NN_based_models` contains the other neural network-based models compared in our paper and `plot_figs` includes some data file processing and graphing code utilized in our research.
